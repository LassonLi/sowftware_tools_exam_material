### Definition of RE:

The requirements for a system are the descriptions of what the system should do— the services that it provides and the constraints on its operation. The process of finding out, analyzing, documenting and checking these services and constraints is called requirements engineering.

**User requirements** are statements, in a natural language plus diagrams, of whatservices the system is expected to provide to system users and the constraintsunder which it must operate.

**System requirements** are more detailed descriptions of the software system’s functions, services, and operational constraints. The system requirements document (sometimes called a functional specification) should define exactly what is to be implemented. It may be part of the contract between the system buyer and the software developers.

#### Definition of software requirement document:

The software requirements document (sometimes called the software requirements specification or SRS) is an official statement of what the system developers should implement.

#### Definition of requirement specification:

Requirements specification is the process of writing down the user and system requirements in a requirements document

#### Ways of writing requirement specification:

Natural language sentences, structure natural language, design description language, graphical notation, mathematical specification

**User requirements** are almost always written in natural language supplemented by appropriate diagrams and tables in the requirements document. 

**System requirements** may also be written in natural language but other notations based on forms, graphical system models, or mathematical system models can also be used.

## KEY POINTS:

Requirements for a software system set out what the system should do and define constraints on its operation and implementation.

! Functional requirements are statements of the services that the system must provide or are descriptions of how some computations must be carried out.

! Non-functional requirements often constrain the system being developed and the development process being used. These might be product requirements, organizational requirements, or external requirements. They often relate to the emergent properties of the system and therefore apply to the system as a whole.

! The software requirements document is an agreed statement of the system requirements. It should be organized so that both system customers and software developers can use it.

! The requirements engineering process includes a feasibility study, requirements elicitation and analysis, requirements specification, requirements validation, and requirements management.

! Requirements elicitation and analysis is an iterative process that can be represented as a spiral of activities—requirements discovery, requirements classification and organization, requirements negotiation, and requirements documentation.

! Requirements validation is the process of checking the requirements for validity, consistency, completeness, realism, and verifiability.

! Business, organizational, and technical changes inevitably lead to changes to the requirements for a software system. Requirements management is the process of managing and controlling these changes.
