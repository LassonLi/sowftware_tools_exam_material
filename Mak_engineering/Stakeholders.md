Developers usually aren't stakeholders.

The **sponsor** provides development funding for a project.

The **Champion** has to be someone with enough power in the organisation to protect the project against ‘political’ threats.

#### **How to identify stakeholders?**

• by asking your sponsor or client;

• by examining what is and what isn’t shown on an organisation chart;

• with a template such as the ‘onion model’;

• by comparison with similar projects;

• by analysing the context of the project.
