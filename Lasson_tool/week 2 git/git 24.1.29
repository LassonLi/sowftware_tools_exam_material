question 1: 
$:git config --global user.email
liweijian@tungee.com

$:git config --global user.name
liweijian

These are my git account in my previous company. 
However my current account on github page is 
13822124279@163.com
LassonLi

but it could still git push to my origin repo? (https://github.com/LassonLi/UOB-software-group19/commits/main/)

question 2: on exercise 3.1.git: 
In mvb vagrant $:git checkout main
Since my branch called master, this command will fail

question 3: on exercise 3.1.git:
Host github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github.com.key.or.whatever.you.called it.
I just want a exact example of it.

question 4: on exercise 3.1.git:
I post a id_ed25519 public key on github SSH keys. However, I don't have the id_ed25519 private key on mvb's vagrant machine(only have it on my laptop). How can I use ssh to git on mvb's vagrant machine?

For example I create a secret repository on github. I can git clone git@github.com:LassonLi/software_practice.git (ssh way) on my labtop. But couldn't git clone on mvb's vagrant

question 5: on exercise 3.1.git: practice the push workflow
If I create a private repository, then there is only one public ssh key on my github? Can other member in my group use ssh to git clone this private repository without sending their public ssh?
