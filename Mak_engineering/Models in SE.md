### Model must satisfy three criteria below:

**1.Mapping criterion:** there is an original object or phenomenon that is mapped to the model. In the sequel, this original object or phenomenon is referred to as “the original”.

**2.Reduction criterion:** not all the properties of the original are mapped on to the model, but the model is somehow reduced. On the other hand, the model must mirror at least some properties of the original.

**3.Pragmatic criterion:** the model can replace the original for some purpose, i.e. the model is useful.

Models can be classified into **Descriptive models** and **prescriptive models**, for example: A model can mirror an existing original (like a photograph), or it can be used as a specification of something to be created (like a construction plan). In the former case, we call it a descriptive model; in the latter case, we call it prescriptive.
