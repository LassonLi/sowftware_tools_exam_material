### Definition of software process:

A software process is a set of related activities that leads to the production of a software product

### All software process must include four activities:

1. Software specification The functionality of the software and constraints on its operation must be defined.

2. Software design and implementation The software to meet the specification must be produced.

3. Software validation The software must be validated to ensure that it does what the customer wants.

4. Software evolution The software must evolve to meet changing customer needs

### Definition of software process model:

a software process model is a simplified representation of a software process.

### Three models:

Waterfall, 

**Incremental development:** This approach interleaves the activities of specification, development, and validation. The system is developed as a series of versions (increments), with each version adding functionality to the previous version.

**Reuse_oriented software engineering:** This approach is based on the existence of a significant number of reusable components. The system development process focuses on integrating these components into a system rather than developing them from scratch.

### Definition of prototyping:

A prototype is an initial version of a software system that is used to demonstrate concepts, try out design options, and find out more about the problem and its possible solutions.

### Definition of incremental delivery:

Incremental delivery  is an approach to software development where some of the developed increments are delivered to the customer and deployed for use in an operational environment.

### Boehm’s spiral model:

the software process is represented as a spiral, rather than a sequence of activities with some backtracking from one activity to another. Each loop in the spiral represents a phase of the software process.

Each loop in the spiral is split into four sectors:

1.Objective setting

2.Risk assessment and reduction

3.Development and validation

4.Planning

### The Rational Unified Process（RUP）:

is an example of a modern process model that has been derived from work on the UML and the associated Unified Software Development Process. It identifies four discrete phases in the software process:

1.Inception The goal of the inception phase is to establish a business case for the system.

2.Elaboration The goals of the elaboration phase are to develop an understanding of the problem domain, establish an architectural framework for the system, develop the project plan, and identify key project risks.

3.Construction The construction phase involves system design, programming, and testing.

4.Transition The final phase of the RUP is concerned with moving the system from the development community to the user community and making it work in a real environment.



# KEY POINT

1.Software processes are the activities involved in producing a software system. Software process models are abstract representations of these processes.

2.General process models describe the organization of software processes. Examples of these general models include the waterfall model, incremental development, and reuse-oriented development.

3.Requirements engineering is the process of developing a software specification. Specifications are intended to communicate the system needs of the customer to the system developers.

4.Design and implementation processes are concerned with transforming a requirements specification into an executable software system. Systematic design methods may be used as part of this transformation.

5.Software validation is the process of checking that the system conforms to its specification and that it meets the real needs of the users of the system.

6.Software evolution takes place when you change existing software systems to meet new requirements. Changes are continuous and the software must evolve to remain useful. 

7.Processes should include activities to cope with change. This may involve a prototyping phase that helps avoid poor decisions on requirements and design. Processes may be structured for iterative development and delivery so that changes may be made without disrupting the system as a whole.

8.The Rational Unified Process is a modern generic process model that is organized into phases (inception, elaboration, construction, and transition) but separates activities (requirements, analysis, and design, etc.) from these phases.
